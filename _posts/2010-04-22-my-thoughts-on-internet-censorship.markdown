Nobody questions Google’s decision of not complying to Chinese
Government’s censor requests because the government is not
democratic. But it is ridiculous when they reject some censor
requests by Government of India or any other democratic government,
because even though these governments do not represent people’s
view in totality, hypothetically they do and Google must respect
the same. The people who think Google is brave and is not doing any
evil by rejecting the requests, must think about the power they are
vesting in Google, the power which would allow Google
to downrightly reject any such requests made in future by an honest
democratic government.
