Ruby has a closely related keyword called **protected** that
differs subtly from **private**. As far as I can tell, the only
reason to learn the difference is so that you can ace a job
interview that asks you "In Ruby, what is the difference between
**private** and **protected**?" But do you really want to work at a
company that asks you such a lame interview question? At his
keynote at RubyConf in 2008, Dave Thomas (author of
*Programming Ruby*) suggested eliminating **protected** from future
versions of Ruby, and I agree with the sentiment. Just use
**private** and you'll be fine. -
