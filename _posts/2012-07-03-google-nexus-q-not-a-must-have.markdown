Nexus Q is a beautiful device with an attractive hardware design. It
also works painlessly with other Android devices.

However, at a price point of $299, there won't be many takers for this
device. It merely serves its purpose of demonstrating the utility of
Android. 

People were slamming doors on Google for its poor entertainment devices
(Google TV). By launching Nexus Q, Google has got a foot in the door.
