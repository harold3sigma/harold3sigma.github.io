Day 1 observations -

-   Python has fairly similar syntax to Ruby.
-   Model in Rails = Model in Django
-   Controller in Rails = View in Django
-   View in Rails = Template in Django
-   Django's documentation is awesome. Rails' documentation is
    awesome as well, but it is for people who know a bit of Rails.

Next steps -

-   Install Django.Â 
-   Create a demo app.
