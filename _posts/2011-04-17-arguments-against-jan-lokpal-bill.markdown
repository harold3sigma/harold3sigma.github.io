**But won't the government appoint corrupt and weak people as Lokpal members? That won't be possible because its members will be selected by judges, citizens and constitutional authorities and not by politicians, through a completely transparent and participatory process.**

Jan Lokpal will be elected by Judges, Citizens and Constitutional
authorities. A politician is also elected by the same citizens. How
can we expect that a person, who voted for Mayawati or Karunanidhi
in assembly elections, will not vote for their kins during Jan
Lokpal elections? Will he have to two standards for elections,
choose a corrupt MP/MLA during political elections (and fly their
political party's flag) and choose an honest Lokpal during Lokpal
elections (and fly a tricolor)? Also, is Indian Judiciary totally
corruption free? Judges are as corrupt as politicians.

**What if some officer in Lokpal becomes corrupt? The entire functioning of Lokpal/ Lokayukta will be completely transparent. Any complaint against any officer of Lokpal shall be investigated and the officer dismissed within two months.**

Then what? Another election? Once bitten, will people become twice
shy? Who will bear the cost of another election? 

**So, you could approach Lokpal if your ration card or passport or voter card is not being made or if police is not registering your case or any other work is not being done in prescribed time. Lokpal will have to get it done in a month's time. You could also report any case of corruption to Lokpal like ration being siphoned off, poor quality roads been constructed or panchayat funds being siphoned off. Lokpal will have to complete its investigations in a year, trial will be over in next one year and the guilty will go to jail within two years.**

Indian Judiciary system is one of the largest in the world. In
spite of that we have millions of pending cases. A single Lokpal
will be more efficient than thousands of judges, huh? 

**Cases against corrupt people will not linger on for years anymore: Investigations in any case will have to be completed in one year. Trial should be completed in next one year so that the corrupt politician, officer or judge is sent to jail within two years.**

This would give people like Medha Patkar and Arundhati Roy, a free
run. Almost all deals (be it good or bad) involve corruption. And
it really does not matter as long as development is going on.
Bribes, at times, are means of making the process more efficient.

**So whats the best thing one can do?** 

Go out and fucking vote in
loksabha elections, assembly elections or local civic body
elections. If two corrupt people are standing in the elections,
vote for the better person and elect him as your MP/MLA. Trust the
power of evolution. It is the most powerful force in this world.
Eventually, evolution will weed out the bad people. It has already
happened. Look at Bihar, MP, Gujarat and Uttarakhand.
