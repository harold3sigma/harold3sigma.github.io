Steve Wozniak said in his book iWoz:

*If you’re that rare engineer who’s an inventor and also an artist, I’m going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is: Work alone. …You’re going to be best able to design revolutionary products and features if you’re working on your own. Not on a committee. Not on a team.*
