Howdy,

Welcome to my site. For those who do not know me \[99.99999 % of the
world\], I am a coder \[in making\], a hardware tinkerer (rendered two
computers useless) and a Linux enthusiast. I am currently working
as an Information Security Consultant and learning Ruby on Rails in
my free time.

I have developed an application in PHP,
[Newzupp](http://www.newzupp.com), which was selected as "Mashup of
The Day" for 12/04/10 by
[ProgrammableWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com). It simply pulls
out popular stories from major social networks \[Digg, Tweetmeme,
Reddit, Delicious and Friendfeed\] and ranks them according to their
total popularity. By covering major social networks, it represents
larger portion of net users. Hence Newzupp offers news in more
democratic manner.

I am trying to develop a "No BS" and more meaningful information
sharing network. I will be using this site to communicate my ideas
and get feedback.
