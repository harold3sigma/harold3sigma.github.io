There are basically two ways to be financially successful as a
company. One, you could rely on time-tested business fundamentals.
I call this the Warren Buffet model.

Two, you could rely on the greater fool theory, which is that with
enough hype, smoke, and mirrors you can find a buyer who is an even
greater fool than your investors.
