We usually check the value of an attribute by using
'**object.attribute.blank?**'. This method works fine when the
attribute has been defined by the user or it has been loaded by the
database. But it will raise a **NoMethodError** if the attribute is
not defined by the user and is not loaded by the database.

We can use **attribute\_present?** method to check both the
existence of an attribute and its value. The method takes
**attribute name** as message and returns boolean value.
