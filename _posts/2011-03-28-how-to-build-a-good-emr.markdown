There is an inherent gap between how engineers think and how
doctors think. Give an engineer some time, food, and money and
there are few limits outside of their imagination as to what they
can create from scratch. The grand majority of doctors, however,
are not builders; they are pattern-recognition machines trained to
recognize constellations of symptoms to diagnose disease and treat
it. Don't underestimate the impact of this difference in
mentality.

When engineers encounter software that doesn't work the way they
want, they either hack it to make it so or find/build other
software that does. When doctors buy a piece of software that is,
in practice, a crappy product, they often keep working with it for
the following reasons:

-   They don’t know that things can be better. 
-   They don’t know how to give useful feedback to the dev team.
-   They don’t have the time to build/seek another solution.
