"Middle men exist to reduce the cost of getting a product from A to
B, and as long as that cost is significant, they will be useful.
However, the moment the middle man monopolizes the means of
distribution, he becomes a gatekeeper, and creators can be made to
fail not by the merits and popularity of their products, but by the
whims and short-term interests of the gatekeeper."
