Here is the list of things I have been working on -

-   Finished a small project for a Dutch client.
    ([Continuleren](http://continuleren.nl/) - A course management
    application for schools)
-   Converted the API and RSS code of
    [Newzupp](http://www.newzupp.com) from CodeIgniter to Rails 3. 

I will be starting on the following things -

-   Application design from scratch for
    [we work . nyc](http://www.weworknyc.com/). This might keep me busy
    for next couple of months.
-   Redesign of [Newzupp](http://www.newzupp.com).
-   Coding a multi-tenant app using Postgresql and Rails 3.
-   Prepare for presentation at
    [New Delhi Ruby Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/delhi-ruby/).

Although none of these things matter to any of the readers, I just
felt like posting it. :D
