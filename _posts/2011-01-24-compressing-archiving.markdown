I know some hackers/coders who do not know the difference between
archiving and compressing. I pity them, for they have never used
any OS other than Windows.

Archiving - Collecting *n* number of files into one file and
preserving the directory structure and links while doing so.
'*tar*' is an archiving format and it is also an utility.

Compressing - Compressing a file or an archive. '*gzip*' ,
'*bzip2*' are compression formats/tools.

'*zip*' does both archiving and compression.
