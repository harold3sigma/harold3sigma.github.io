I am working as a professional programmer since last 3 and a half years.
I am proficient with ruby, javascript and basic devops.

Before working as a programmer, I worked with IBM as an SAP consultant
and then as an independent Information Security Auditor.

Presently, I am working on a personal project ([Adhi](http://adhi.in)). It is an online assessment platform and 
a few schools are already beta testing it.

Here are some more details about the coding projects that I have worked
on -

------------

####[Adhi](http://adhi.in)

Adhi is a platform that powers (will power) online assessment systems of
schools and other educational institutions. The app features responsive
design and can be used from a smartphone, tablet or computer.

####[Desklets](http://desklets.com/)

Desklets is a site to list shared workspaces. Similar to AirBnB. I built
the initial MVP that was supposed to be launched during London Olympics
2012, but due to some business reasons, the client could not launch it.

#####Technologies Used

Ruby on Rails 3.1, MySQL, Ubuntu Server

------------------

####[Printfriendly](http://Printfriendly.com)

Printfriendly makes web pages more readable. It provides browser
extensions and bookmarklets that help users in doing so. I optimized
their page rendering algorithm to improve its speed. I also made some
changes that enabled it to parse poorly designed sites. Additionally, I added
internationalization features to client side script, created browser addons
for Chrome and Firefox, and developed plugin for Blogger platform.

#####Technologies Used

Javascript, Chrome and Firefox browser APIs

####[Vinsol](http://vinsol.com)

Vinsol is one of the leading ruby consulting companies of India. I
worked with Vinsol for a year and half as a full time ruby developer. At
Vinsol, I worked on many client projects and delivered a few start-to-end
projects.

Here are some of the projects I worked on at Vinsol -

--------------------

#####Internal Ad Analytics Tool for [sidereel.com](http://sidereel.com)

I and my colleague built a quick prototype that helped sidereel team
make sense out of millions of visitor records generated on a daily
basis. The work involved preparing some complex SQL queries that could
process tables with millions of rows.

-------------------

#####[Dealdey](http://dealdey.com)

Dealdey is one the largest daily deals site in Africa. I built a
platform - Luxebridge - for luxury product flash sales. About a year
ago, they merged that site with Dealdey.com.

#####Technologies Used

####[Playup](http://playupindia.com)

Playup is a global company that builds mobile games based on real world
sports. In November of 2010, they approached us with an idea of building
two SMS based games - NextWicket and 10UP - for the upcoming Cricket Worldcup 2011.

*NextWicket* - It's a game where a player predict the next wicket (the
batsman who get's out) and send it via SMS. If the player gets it
right then he can play for next wicket else he gets knocked out. In the
end, all those who are in game share a pool of prizes.

*10UP* - It's a game where during live game, players are sent trivia
questions about current teams. The game format - moving forward and
getting knocked out - is similar to NextWicket.

I and my colleague helped in brainstorming the game features with their product
management team. We also built the application backend with service
oriented architecture. The app was deployed on multiple nodes with 7
small apps communicating with each other via their respective APIs. We
also integrated the app backend with all major mobile gateways. At its
peak, the app was supporting incoming messages at a rate of 50 messages
per second.

This is a rough rendering of the backend architecture -

#####Technologies Used
Rails 3, Redis, MySQL, Ubuntu Server, HAProxy to balance load between
incoming message handler services

-----------------------

#####[Continuleren](http://continuleren.nl)

Continuleren is a dutch HR management and learning application. I added
some features to the existing application.

#####Technologies Used

--------------------

Along with my professional gigs, I also worked on a few side projects on
mine.

####Newzupp

Newzupp is a pet project idea that went through numerous iterations.

####[v1](http://www.programmableweb.com/mashup/newzupp)

![Newzupp v1](/images/work/newzuppv1.png)

_Unfortunately, I am unable to find any screenshot of actual website
:-(_

In 2009, I thought of learning CodeIgniter framework. And, I decided to
do so by making a simple site. Newzupp was that site. It fetched popular
stories from HackerNews, Reddit, Twitter, Digg, Friendfeed and Facebook
and compiled a list of most popular links on web at any given moment. I
launched it and within a week it got selected as ProgrammableWeb's
"Mashup of the day". :-)

Technologies Used: PHP, CodeIgniter, APIs of Twitter, Digg, Reddit,
TweetMeme, Facebook and Friendfeed


####[v2](http://jigarpatel.in/blog/2011/02/28/how-i-built-newzupp-in-30-hours/)

![Newzupp v2](/images/work/newzupp.jpg)

In 2011, I decided to rewrite the application in Ruby on Rails. I did it
over a weekend in 30 hours. I also added some other aggregators.

The code is open on [Github](http://github.com/jagira/newzupp).

I documented the development process
[here](http://jigarpatel.in/blog/2011/02/28/how-i-built-newzupp-in-30-hours/). And, [here is my HackerNews submission](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2271119).

Technologies Used: Rails 3.0, MySQL, APIs of Twitter, HackerNews,
Reddit, Facebook and Digg

####[v3](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/newzupp/anlghlhbnaigodcegjhphedhkejdlgho?hl=en)

I built a web app and an browser extension that allowed users to leave
notes on web pages. Kind of like Foursquare for websites.

![Newzupp v3](/images/work/newzupp_v2.png)

My friend MNH tried to explain the app via a [blog
post](http://nmanne.blogspot.in/2011/06/what-is-newzupp-and-why-is-this-one-app.html).

Source code - [Rails Backend](https://bitbucket.org/jagira/newzupp_v2)
and [Chrome
Extension](https://bitbucket.org/jagira/newzupp_v2_chrome_extension)

Technologies Used: Rails 3, MongoDB, Google Chrome's browser APIs

---------------------------------------------

I also worked as an independent Information Security Auditor, wherein I
audited the IT infrastructure of some large Indian corporations and banks like PowerGrid Corp, NHDC Limited, Corporation Bank and IRCON International Limited.
